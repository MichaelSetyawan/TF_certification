# TF_certification
My ongoing journey of learning and preparation for Google's TF Developer Certification. <br>

Mainly based on Daniel's Bourke [online course](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/learn-tensorflow?affcode=441520_izj92vzu) & the [course's GitHub.](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/)<br>

I try to pick similar datasets from Kaggle and apply similar analysis with extra visualizations.<br>
